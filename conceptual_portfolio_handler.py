# --- conceptual_portfolio_handler.py ---
# Purpose: Illustrative backend logic for creating a new portfolio item,
# including conceptual calls to AI services for tags and captions.
# This guides the development of the POST /api/v1/portfolio-items endpoint.

# Assume Flask-like imports for request handling and JSON responses
# from flask import request, jsonify # Not used in this conceptual text but for context
# For real AI calls, you'd use libraries like:
# import google.cloud.vision as vision # Example for Google Vision AI
# import openai # Example for OpenAI GPT
